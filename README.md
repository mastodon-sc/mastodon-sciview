10-11-2024: This project is considered deprecated in favor of newer, bigger, and better [`Mastodon-sciview Bridge (take2)`](https://github.com/xulman/mastodon-sciview-take2).

# What is mastodon-sciview?

.... a piece of magic (aka TBA).

# How to test?

- compile
- start `SciViewPlugin.main()`
- shows Fiji window and Mastodon window
- open some project in Mastodon
- open BDV window in Mastodon
- start sciview from BDV's menu: Plugins -> start sciview
- `Volume`s are disabled, should show spots (as `Sphere`s) only
